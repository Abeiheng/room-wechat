On March 23-24, representing the Wechaty open-source community, I attended the ["2024 Global Developer Conference" (GDC)](https://my.globalaidc.com/pc/page/b4070000-a7d2-36dc-08e0-08dc1af77df3?theme=bvent) in Shanghai.

[Wechaty](https://wechaty.js.org), as the world's largest conversational RPA framework, currently has nearly 20,000 stars on GitHub. The contributors to its code come from over 20 countries and regions worldwide, providing a concise and powerful instant messaging (IM) integration solution to developers globally.

At GDC, I provided in-depth explanations and demonstrations on how to combine artificial intelligence with automation using Wechaty, covering everything from coding implementation to practical applications, showcasing the impressive flexibility of Wechaty.

Additionally, in response to the call to "encourage women's participation in technology," as a Wechaty advocate, I supported a female fan who is a chatbot developer in delivering a fantastic presentation to a global audience.
